## Conclusion & Future Aspirations

I am a passionate data analytics enthusiast with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and data preprocessing. My portfolio showcases projects where I have applied data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights. Through hands-on experience with datasets like mentioned above, I have developed a keen interest in business-driven data analysis.

To further strengthen my data analytics skills, I am currently enrolled in a 5-month Applied data science and machine learning course, where I am learning advanced data visualization (Power BI/Tableau), SQL, statistical analysis, business intelligence, and predictive modeling techniques. This course is helping me develop a deeper understanding of how data-driven insights impact decision-making in real-world scenarios.

I am actively seeking a Data Analytics Internship where I can apply my knowledge and continue learning in a real-world business environment. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) or explore my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/dashboard). I look forward to collaborating and gaining hands-on experience in the field of data analytics!
